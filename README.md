# Hail on Amazon EMR: `cloudformation` tool with spot instances

This `cloudformation` tool  (MAC and Linux compatible) creates an EMR cluster using [spot instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-spot-instances.html), a cost effective option  (using a bid price) to deploy clusters. Once your cluster is up and running it will have both the latest [**Hail 0.2**](https://www.hail.is) version and `JupyterNotebook` installed.

## IMPORTANT: Software requirements

This tool requires the following programs to be previously installed in your computer (see details in section **Before getting started**):
* Python3, pip and some additional python libraries
* Amazon's `Command Line Interface (CLI)` utility

To install the required software  open a terminal and execute the following:

#### For MAC
```bash
# Installs homebrew
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
# Installs python3
brew install python3
# Upgrades pip
pip3 install --upgrade pip
#Installs additional libraries

```

## Before getting started

This tool is executed from the terminal/command line using Amazon's `CLI` utility. Before spinning gears, make sure you have:

a) **A configured `CLI` account**. From the terminal execute `aws configure`, [click here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html) for additional information. If your `CLI` account has been previously configured, the tool will use such configuration by default. If you want to re-configure and use a specific account or a different user, execute `aws configure` and re-configure your account

b) **A valid EC2 key pair**. [Click here]( https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html) to learn more on how to create and use your key. **Safety remark**: once you have your key make sure to set the proper permissions for it: `chmod 400 my-key.pem`.

### How to use this `cloudformation` tool

1. Open a terminal and clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/hms-dbmi/hail-on-AWS-spot-instances`

2. Change directories: `cd hail-on-AWS-spot-instances/src`

3. Using the text editor of your preference (sublime, atom, vi, emacs, etc) update the configuration file `config_EMR_spot.yaml` as per the instructions below. This file is your gateway to properly spinning a cluster and it requires specific elements to successfully create your working cluster. Before heading to step **4**, follow the instructions explained beneath.

    #### Instructions to properly configure your `config_EMR_spot.yaml` file

    This file will be used to provide the necessary information to create the cluster (do not change the name of the file). Give a name to your `EMR_CLUSTER_NAME` and add meaningful information by properly identifying your `EC2_NAME_TAG`, `OWNER_TAG` and `PROJECT_TAG`. The file in the repo is defaulted to region `us-east-1`, one `m4.large` master node and two `r4.4xlarge` worker nodes. You can change all this parameters to whatever suits your application.

    ```yaml
    config:
      EMR_CLUSTER_NAME: "my-hail-02-cluster" # Give a name to your EMR cluster
      EC2_NAME_TAG: "my-hail-EMR" # Adds a tag to the individual EC2 instances
      OWNER_TAG: "emr-owner" # EC2 owner tag
      PROJECT_TAG: "my-project" # Project tag
      REGION: "us-east-1"
      MASTER_INSTANCE_TYPE: "m4.large"
      WORKER_INSTANCE_TYPE: "r4.4xlarge"
      WORKER_COUNT: "2" # Number of worker nodes
      WORKER_BID_PRICE: "0.44" # Required for spot instances
      SUBNET_ID: "" # This field can be either left blank or for further security you can specify your private subnet ID in the form: subnet-1a2b3c4d
      S3_BUCKET: "s3n://my-s3-bucket/" # Specify your S3 bucket for EMR log storage
      KEY_NAME: "my-key" # Input your key name ONLY! DO NOT include the .pem extension
      PATH_TO_KEY: "/full-path-to/my-key/" # Full path to the .pem file
      WORKER_SECURITY_GROUP: "" # If empty creates a new group by default. You can also add a specific SG. See the SG link in the FAQs section
      MASTER_SECURITY_GROUP: "" # If empty creates a new group by default. You can also add a specific SG. See the SG link in the FAQs section
      EBS_VOLUME_SIZE: "32" # Size in GB of attached EBS volume
    ```

    3.1. Select the **EC2** instances for your `MASTER_INSTANCE_TYPE` and your `WORKER_INSTANCE_TYPE`. It is recommended to use a small generic EC2 for the master, such as  `m4.large`, and more powerful EC2s (compute or memory optimized) for your worker nodes such as `r4.4large`. See the different EC2 types [available  here](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/).

    |Suggested EC2s (**`WORKER_INSTANCE_TYPE`**) |
    |:-------------------------:|
    | c4.4xlarge |
    | r4.2xlarge |
    | r4.4xlarge |

    Since we are using spot instances, the worker nodes require a maximum bid price to be specified. The field `WORKER_BID_PRICE` specifies the maximum cost that we will pay for each of the worker nodes. To choose an accurate and competitive bid price for your worker nodes, login to the [EMR management console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/elasticmapreduce):

    <img src="https://github.com/hms-dbmi/hail-on-AWS-spot-instances/blob/master/images/AWS_login.png" width="350">

    Click on **Create cluster**:

    <img src="https://github.com/hms-dbmi/hail-on-AWS-spot-instances/blob/master/images/create_cluster.png" width="600">

    Then, click on **Go to advanced options**:

    <img src="https://github.com/hms-dbmi/hail-on-AWS-spot-instances/blob/master/images/advanced_options.png" width="600">

    You will be taken to *Step 1: Software and Steps*, click **Next**:

    <img src="https://github.com/hms-dbmi/hail-on-AWS-spot-instances/blob/master/images/step1.png" width="800">

    Here, click on the instance type selection pencil **(1)** to find your worker node type. Within the list select your desired instance type and click on the **Save** button. Next, hover over the ***i*** icon **(2)** to show the current spot price for such instance:

    <img src="https://github.com/hms-dbmi/hail-on-AWS-spot-instances/blob/master/images/spot_price.png" width="1024">

    Prices vary based on demand and by the **Subnet** with its corresponding **Availability Zone** (*subnet-053f834c* and zone *us-east-1a* in this example), where the later dictates the bid price; a good practice is to identify the current prices per subnet/zone and just go slightly above such price to guarantee that you will be promptly provisioned with instances. Even though you specify a higher bid price, you will still pay less if a lower price is available for your zone. The example below shows a suggested bid of $0.44 for `r4.4xlarge` instances in zones 1a and 1c:

    <img src="https://github.com/hms-dbmi/hail-on-AWS-spot-instances/blob/master/images/prices.png" width="420">

    3.2. For your `SUBNET_ID` you can either specify the subnet from the previous step (i.e. subnet-053f834c) or you can also choose a specific one from the [VPC Dashboard](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc), click on **Subnets** on the left panel:

    <img src="https://github.com/hms-dbmi/hail-on-AWS-spot-instances/blob/master/images/subnet_id.png" width="1024">

    For instance pricing, follow the guidelines from step **3.1**. The price is given by the **zone** where your subnet is located.

    3.3. The `S3_BUCKET` field specifies a location to store all the logs of your cluster (i.e. s3n://my-s3-bucket/). If you leave it blank ("") the log folder will be created under your **S3 root** folder. The log folder will have the same name as your automatically assigned EMR cluster ID (i.e. *j-123EMRID3210*)

    3.4. The `KEY_NAME` field must include the name of your key **without** the extension. If your key file is `my-key.pem` only put `my-key`. The `PATH_TO_KEY` field requires the full path pointing to the key file. For additional details upon your key scroll up to the **Before getting started** section in this repo.

    3.5. In order to specify the `WORKER_SECURITY_GROUP` and `MASTER_SECURITY_GROUP` go to the [VPC Dashboard](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc) and from the left panel *Security* >> Security Groups . Note: if these two fields are left empty (default in the configuration file) the security groups are automatically assigned. **IMPORTANT:** to properly access the `JupyterNotebook` from the browser, the port `8192` has to be added to the inbound rules of your `MASTER_SECURITY_GROUP`. To achieve this, and once you are in the  Security Groups page, select your desired group:

      <img src="https://github.com/hms-dbmi/hail-on-AWS-spot-instances/blob/master/images/security_group.png" width="1024">

      Click on the **Inbound Rules** tab to double check if port `8192` is on the list. To add the port click on **Edit Rules** and use one of the two configurations suggested below:

      <img src="https://github.com/hms-dbmi/hail-on-AWS-spot-instances/blob/master/images/security_group_options.png" width="1024">

      Click [here]( https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ManagementGuide/emr-security-groups.html) for additional documentation on security groups.


4. Once the configuration file is properly filled and saved, go back to the terminal and from the `src` folder `hail-on-AWS-spot-instances/src` execute the command: **`sh cloudformation_hail_spot.sh`**. The EMR cluster creation takes between 7-10 minutes (depending on EC2 availability). **DO NOT** terminate the script execution as you will automatically get the IP address to connect to the `JypyterNotebook` in the form: **`123.456.0.1:8192`**. Here's a sample screenshot  showing what you get once the cluster is successfully created:

<img src="https://github.com/hms-dbmi/hail-on-AWS-spot-instances/blob/master/images/starting_EMR.png" width="750">

(Optional) The full log of the EMR provisioning can be found at: `/tmp/cloudcreation_log.out`.


5. You can check the status of the EMR creation at: https://console.aws.amazon.com/elasticmapreduce. The EMR is successfully created once it gets the **Status** `Waiting` and a solid green circle to the left of the cluster Name.

<img src="https://github.com/hms-dbmi/hail-on-AWS-spot-instances/blob/master/images/emr_waiting.png" width="650">

After the cluster is created, allow for automatic program installation and configuration (~20 minutes). No additional action is required but to wait for the installation process to complete. (Optional) In addition, the script will also provide the public DNS to connect to the master node. [Click here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ManagementGuide/emr-connect-master-node-ssh.html) for instructions on how to connect to the master node to monitor progress (the program installation log at the master node of your EMR is saved at the path: `/tmp/cloudcreation_log.out`):

## Launching the `JupyterNotebook`

To launch the  `JupyterNotebook` you need to paste the previously given IP (*`123.456.0.1:8192`* this is the master node's IP pointing to port 8192) in a browser and hit `Enter`; once you see the following screen:

<img src="https://github.com/hms-dbmi/hail-on-AWS-spot-instances/blob/master/images/jupyter.png" width="350">

use password: **`avillach`** to login. If you successfully log in, you are all set!


## FAQs and troubleshooting

* Some times you may get sudden or unexpected errors. One of the reasons may be the fact that your initial spot instances can be dropped and replaced by a new instance (that's how the spot instance model works). This `cloudformation` tool constantly --every minute-- checks for this behavior and will fix everything for you. A common error when an instance is replaced is:

```java
FatalError: ClassNotFoundException: is.hail.kryo.HailKryoRegistrator
```

* For this and other `JupyterNotebook` glitches, you only need to restart the kernel by clicking on `Kernel` >> `Restart` or `Restart & Run All`:
